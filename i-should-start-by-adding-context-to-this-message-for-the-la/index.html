For the last year+ I’ve been doing research on human performance, specifically for weightlifting and swim/polo, and I’ve collated and analyzed over 150 relevant studies on sport physiology to redesign traditional training programs.

If you want to swim faster one time(ex. 25 yard sprint) you need to increase your power (force times distance divided by time). This is done by improving technique (we can talk about that after summer), by muscle growth (hypertrophy), and by encoding the higher-level movement into the central nervous system (CNS). The specific muscles used for swimming are connected to the shoulder: coracobrachialis, anterior deltoid, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, infraspinatus, teres minor, and supraspinatus. The only way to effectively improve them is to repeatedly push them close to local metabolic failure during training. This means using small portions of “quick energy”, adenosine triphosphate and phosphocreatine (ATP-CP), but not depleting the store of energy on each repetition. When you feel the “burn” you have fully exhausted the quick energy in the local muscle, causing acidosis and lactate accumulation, due to poor oxygen utilization. Essentially, you need to rest because of the energy byproducts in your bloodstream. You have not pushed the specific muscles as close to failure as you can since you won't be able to continue to train at a high intensity once the burn begins. You would be surprised by how much work your muscles can actually do in a training session before they fail (spoiler: it’s an additional 50-100%).   </p><p><b data-grid-id="66812841-4b01-42c6-b9e8-968e25827586"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coracobrachialis_muscle"></a><a href="http://www.exrx.net/Muscles/DeltoidAnterior.html"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infraspinatus_muscle"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teres_minor_muscle"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supraspinatus_muscle"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphocreatine"></a><br></b></p><p><br/></p><p> type of heavy work also spikes testosterone but that occurs at about 17 hours post-training.

It is easier to down-regulate effort (go slower) versus up-regulating effort to a level you never practice. Trying to up-regulate effort in a game is what you are doing when you swim 10x50s on a :45 for training. It takes about 4 weeks to maximize anaerobic efficiency and 12 weeks for aerobic efficiency. After that, especially in swimming, improvements come from technique changes and very specific muscle overload methods. That’s for after summer.</p><p><b>“</b>You have to swim fast to swim fast” -Ryan</p><p></p><p></p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
