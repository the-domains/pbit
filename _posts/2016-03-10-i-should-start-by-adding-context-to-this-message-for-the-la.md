I should start by adding context to this message. For the last year+ I've been doing research on human performance, specifically for weightlifting and swim/polo, and I've collated and analyzed over 150 relevant studies on sport physiology to redesign traditional training programs. I'm writing a book on this - it's almost done.

I talk in specifics and not generalities. If you want to swim faster one time(ex. 25 yard sprint) you need to increase your power (force times distance divided by time). This is done by improving technique (we can talk about that after summer), by muscle growth (hypertrophy), and by encoding the higher-level movement into the central nervous system (CNS). The specific muscles used for swimming are connected to the shoulder: coracobrachialis, anterior deltoid, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, infraspinatus, teres minor, and supraspinatus. The only way to effectively improve them is to repeatedly push them close to local metabolic failure during training. This means using small portions of "quick energy", adenosine triphosphate and phosphocreatine (ATP-CP), but not depleting the store of energy on each repetition. When you feel the "burn" you have fully exhausted the quick energy in the local muscle, causing acidosis and lactate accumulation, due to poor oxygen utilization. Essentially, you need to rest because of the energy byproducts in your bloodstream. You have not pushed the specific muscles as close to failure as you can since you won't be able to continue to train at a high intensity once the burn begins. You would be surprised by how much work your muscles can actually do in a training session before they fail (spoiler: it's an additional 50-100%).

type of heavy work also spikes testosterone but that occurs at about 17 hours post-training. Decreasing the intervals to 25 seconds each, 50 seconds per cycle, is the next step.

Session 2 is aerobic and the trained muscle groups are separate.

Swim:

**  
**

1. 4-6 15 yard full sprints on a 40 second interval. All head-up is good or take the first few strokes head down. This is the mechanism to improve your 100% level. It's almost impossible to full sprint more than 6 of these on a 40\. If you can you're not at 100%.
2. 10-14 15 yard swims at 90% max speed on a 25 second interval. After a few sessions you can crank this down to a 20 second interval. Take a 2 minute break.
3. Repeat number 2 as much as you want. If you struggled to get to 10 reps on the first set add 5 seconds to the interval for the next sets. After a few sessions your 90% should be getting faster as well. 

****

Legs:

**  
**

1. 9-12 all-out 5 second eggbeater bursts, on a 20 second interval. Get as high out of the water as you can. I do these with only one arm up to shot block. 1 minute rest.
2. Repeat as much as you want. After a few sessions try them on a 15 second interval but it is more important that you are improving height by going all out.

****

The rep range is a guideline. If you "feel" the fatigue in the muscle stop and take a break. This session is designed to create an oxygen debt - you may need to take a break due to respiratory failure (can't catch your breath) even though the muscles aren't tired. This effect will force the chest cavity muscles to adapt during recovery along with other effects discussed. It takes about 2 minutes to get your oxygen system fully activated so if you can't do at least 6 you should start with a 25 second interval. 

**  
**

Swimming and eggbeating close to maximum effort burns those motions into your CNS so that you don't need to "think" about going faster in a game. It is easier to down-regulate effort (go slower) versus up-regulating effort to a level you never practice. Trying to up-regulate effort in a game is what you are doing when you swim 10x50s on a :45 for training. It takes about 4 weeks to maximize anaerobic efficiency and 12 weeks for aerobic efficiency. After that, especially in swimming, improvements come from technique changes and very specific muscle overload methods. That's for after summer.
